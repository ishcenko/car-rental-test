The city of metallurgists, heavy industry,\n        lush greenery and \"Martian\" red quarry dust. It occupies a huge area,\n        the distance between the two most distant microdistricts of the city\n        (Terny and Ingulets) is more than 120 kilometers, it is rightfully\n        considered one of the longest settlements in Europe. In its conditions,\n        the topic of car rental is very relevant for residents and guests of the\n        city. Not everyone who lives in Kryvyi Rih or periodically comes here\n        for work or personal business finds it beneficial to have a personal car\n        and use their own vehicle for business purposes. City roads still leave\n        much to be desired. Plus, it's not a secret for anyone that owning a car\n        involves the constant bearing of considerable costs related to scheduled\n        maintenance, repairs, insurance, and car safety. Often, it is much more\n        efficient to rent a car on a daily, weekly or even monthly basis and not\n        think about exorbitant costs directly related to the content of the car.\n        Every year, a larger part of the country's population, including\n        residents of the city of metallurgists, is thinking about this topic. If\n        you also do not want to be permanently tied to a car, for personal or\n        work purposes you plan to rent a car in Kryvyi Rih, study the\n        possibilities and conditions of cooperation from the transport company\n        \"CAR-RENT\". We will help you to arrange a daily or long-term car rental\n        with or without a driver in Kryvyi Rih on the best terms for comfortable\n        movement around the city and its surroundings. At the stage of selecting\n        a car and signing a lease agreement in the customer's company, several\n        questions are usually of interest, namely: What does the car rental\n        service include? The rental cost includes: a fully ready-to-use car\n        (cleaned and refueled to a full tank). The rental cost also includes\n        comprehensive \"CASCO\" insurance with a deductible. What are the terms of\n        car rental and the procedure for its registration? To sign a car rental\n        agreement without a driver, the lessee must present a passport and tax\n        identification number (TIN). The customer must also be at least 21 years\n        old, have a valid driver's license, and a minimum of 2 years of driving\n        experience. Car rental can be done with or without a security deposit.\n        In the latter case, the cost of the service will be higher. To rent a\n        car, you can submit a request on the company's website. In a reasonable\n        time, a manager will contact the customer to agree on the car model and\n        the rental period. How to pick up and return the car After selecting,\n        agreeing on the details, and signing the rental agreement, you can pick\n        up the car (delivery to the specified address is possible).
